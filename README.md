A weekend project - Quantum shooting game on an Arduino 

## Things you'll need 

> You can find most of these items in your local hobby electronics store or on amazon

- 1x Arduino            
- 2x Joysticks               
- 6x Push Buttons (at least)      
- 1x Mini OLED display (or a display of your choice)         
- 2x Mini Breadboards (or just solder it onto a circuit board)      
- Lot of jumper wires       
- Power source (usb, battery, etc.)

> if you want a finished product you could 3d print a casing on top! (that'd be cool) I'm currently working on it too, I'll make sure I share the details here if I do sketch, print and test the designs.
